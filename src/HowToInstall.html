<b> AfterCodecs is a new native exporter for Adobe After Effects, Premiere Pro and Media
	Encoder</b> CC 2015+ on Windows 7+ and Mac OS X 10.10+, bringing you ProRes, H264, H265 &
Hap codecs for excellent quality and lightweight videos.
   Common text for both platforms.

<h1> Installation</h1>
You can <b>skip step 1 and 3 on Windows with the given setup and skip step 1 on OSX with the
setup package. </b>
You can also skip the two first steps by using the aescripts + aeplugins manager application.

Whole installation steps :
<ol>
	<li>On Windows/OSX copy the .aex / .plugin (AE) and .prm / .bundle (PP/ME) into the Plugins
		folder of you host installation directory, for example :
		<p class="win">
		(Windows) C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC 2017\Support
		Files\Plug-ins
		</p>
		<p class="osx">
		(OSX) /Applications/Adobe After Effects CC 2017/Plug-ins
		</p>
		<b>If you have multiple versions or mutiple hosts installed you can also put it in the
			common folder : </b>
		<p class="win">(Windows) C:\Program Files\Adobe\Common\Plug-ins\7.0\MediaCore</p>
		<p class="osx">(OSX) /Library/Application
			Support/Adobe/Common/Plug-ins/7.0/MediaCore/</p></li>
	<li>Now you have to license the plugins, please open it up by trying to export something, on
		AE : choose "AfterCodecs .mov" then press the "Format Options" button to open up
		AfterCodecs' dialog. Go to the "Settings" tab, enter you license and press the "Activate
		license" button. On PP / ME you need to export or convert something and choose
		"AfterCodecs" in the codec list and there is a button "AfterCodecs Settings" in the
		options.

	</li>
	<li>In the same tab you now have to download ffmpeg binaries, just press the "Download /
		Update" button and wait for the download to finish. It will create this folder :
		<p class="win">(Windows) %appdata%/Autokroma/ffmpeg </p>
		<p class="osx">(OSX) ~/Library/Application Support/Autokroma/ffmpeg </p>
		and extract ffmpeg, ffkroma binaries into it. You can also do this manually (if you
		encountered the "invalid zip file" error) by downloading the zip at the bottom of this
		page http://aescripts.com/aftercodecs/ and extracting the files and creating the folder
		on your own. This should look like this at the end (with Autokroma, not Dornisoft) :

		<p class="win">
			<img src="images/win1.png" width="700">
			<br>
			<img src="images/win2.png" width="700">
		</p>
		<p class="osx">
			<img src="images/mac.png" width="700" >
			<br>
			<img src="images/mac2.png" width="700">
		</p>

		Please not that there's always a minimal version of ffmpeg / ffkroma needed to run
		AfterCodecs ! <b>If you see a red message, please update.</b>
	</li>

	<h1>How AfterCodecs works</h1>
	AfterCodecs sends your data into ffmpeg in order to encode it. The logging feature enables
	power users to read AfterCodecs' and ffmpeg's output logs. On AE : If you have both video and
	audio, temporary files will be written (suffixed .video.mov and .audio.wav) and there is an
	additional muxing step at the end of the render (a progressbar will pop up on Windows).
	Please bear in mind that After Effects will prevent you from overwriting the final output file,
	but not temporary ones. You can even stop the render at any time and the rendered files will
	be fine, storing what has been currently rendered. On PPro / AME : If you have audio, a
	temporary WAV file will be written (suffixed .audio.wav). Please bear in mind that AfterCodecs
	will not prevent you from overwriting temporary files.

	<h1>PP /ME : Extensions : MP4, MOV (QuickTime), EXT</h1>
	Select the EXT extension to save up time if you are doing huge renders (multi gigabytes) or if
	you want to remove the "File already exists. Do you want to replace it." confirmation popup.
	This option is not compatible with having post render actions such as automatic uploading to
	the web. The reason this option exists is that on huge files, PP and ME will spend multiple
	minutes to parse the file (make the test to see if it's an issue for you !)

	<h1>PP /ME : Match Source + Preset</h1>
	Don't forget to press the "Match Source" button in order to conform Resolution, Framerate
	and Pixel Aspect Ratio to the source (the button will automatically tick the checkboxes at the
	right). If you record any preset also press the Match Source button before so that you are sure
	you are not saving thoses parameters in the preset.
	<h1>Feedback</h1>
	For any issue please contact us on aescripts + aeplugins by opening up a ticket and provide a
	logging file and precising AE or Ppr / AME http://aescripts.com/contact/?
	direct=1&SKU=DSTAC-SUL .
