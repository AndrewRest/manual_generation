<p> <span class = "bold">AfterCodecs is a new native exporter for Adobe After Effects, Premiere Pro and Media
    Encoder </span> CC 2015+ on Windows 7+ and Mac OS X 10.10+, bringing you ProRes, H264, H265 &
Hap codecs for excellent quality and lightweight videos.
</p>
<p>
<h3> Installation </h3>
</p>
<p>
    You can  <span class = "bold"> step 1 and 3 on Windows with the given setup and skip step 1 on OSX with the setup package.</span>
</p>
<p>
    setup package.
</p>

<p> You can also skip the two first steps by using the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://aescripts.com/learn/aescripts-aeplugins-manager-app/">aescripts + aeplugins manager</a>
    application.
</p>
<ol> Whole installation steps :
    <p>
    <li> On Windows/OSX copy the .aex / .plugin (AE) and .prm / .bundle (PP/ME) into the Plugins
        folder of you host installation directory, for example :
        <span class = "windows">(Windows) C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC 2017\Support
            Files\Plug-ins </span>
        <span class ="OSX">(OSX) /Applications/Adobe After Effects CC 2017/Plug-ins </span>
        <span class = "bold"> If you have multiple versions or mutiple hosts installed you can also put it in the
            common folder : </span>
        <span class = "windows">(Windows) C:\Program Files\Adobe\Common\Plug-ins\7.0\MediaCore </span>
        <span class ="osx">(OSX) /Library/Application </span>
        Support/Adobe/Common/Plug-ins/7.0/MediaCore/
    </li>
    </p>
    <p>
    <li>
        Now you have to license the plugins, please open it up by trying to export something, on
        AE : choose "AfterCodecs .mov" then press the "Format Options" button to open up
        AfterCodecs' dialog. Go to the "Settings" tab, enter you license and press the "Activate
        license" button. On PP / ME you need to export or convert something and choose
        "AfterCodecs" in the codec list and there is a button "AfterCodecs Settings" in the
        options.
    </li>
    <p><img src="images/ios_example.png"></p>
    </p>
    <li>
        In the same tab you now have to download ffmpeg binaries, just press the "Download /
        Update" button and wait for the download to finish. It will create this folder :
        <span class = "windows">(Windows) %appdata%/Autokroma/ffmpeg </span>
        <span class ="OSX">(OSX) ~/Library/Application Support/Autokroma/ffmpeg </span>
        and extract ffmpeg, ffkroma binaries into it. You can also do this manually <span class = "bold"> (if you
        encountered the "invalid zip file" error)</span> by downloading the zip at the bottom of this
        page http://aescripts.com/aftercodecs/ and extracting the files and creating the folder
        on your own. This should look like this at the end (with Autokroma, not Dornisoft) :
    </li>
    <p><img src="images/ios_example_2.png"></p>
    <p>Please not that there's always a minimal version of ffmpeg / ffkroma needed to run
        AfterCodecs ! <span class = "update"> If you see a red message, please update.</span></p>
</ol>
<p>
<h3>How AfterCodecs works</h3></p>
<p>AfterCodecs sends your data into ffmpeg in order to encode it. The logging feature enables
    power users to read AfterCodecs' and ffmpeg's output logs. On AE : If you have both video and
    audio, temporary files will be written (suffixed .video.mov and .audio.wav) and there is an
    additional muxing step at the end of the render (a progressbar will pop up on Windows).
    Please bear in mind that After Effects will prevent you from overwriting the final output file,
    <span class = "bold"> but not temporary ones.</span> You can even stop the render at any time and the rendered files will
    be fine, storing what has been currently rendered. On PPro / AME : If you have audio, a
    temporary WAV file will be written (suffixed .audio.wav). Please bear in mind that AfterCodecs
    will not prevent you from overwriting temporary files.
</p>

<p>
<h3>PP /ME : Extensions : MP4, MOV (QuickTime), EXT</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Select the EXT extension to save up time if you are doing huge renders (multi gigabytes) or if
    you want to remove the "File already exists. Do you want to replace it." confirmation popup.
    This option is not compatible with having post render actions such as automatic uploading to
    the web. <span class = "bold"> The reason this option exists is that on huge files, PP and ME will spend multiple
    minutes to parse the file (make the test to see if it's an issue for you !) </span>
</p>
<p>
<h3>PP /ME : Match Source + Preset</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Don't forget to press the "Match Source" button in order to conform Resolution, Framerate
    and Pixel Aspect Ratio to the source (the button will automatically tick the checkboxes at the
    right). If you record any preset also press the Match Source button before so that you are sure
    you are not saving thoses parameters in the preset.
